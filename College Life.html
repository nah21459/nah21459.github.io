It has always been my dream to attend the University of Georgia and now I am in Athens “living the dream”. I plan to major in Management Information Systems at the Terry College of Business. I have been involved with multiple organizations including: UGA Swim Club, UGA Miracle, and College Life. After attending numerous College Life functions last year, I decided to become more active in this organization. Currently, I am a Wyldlife leader at Oconee County Middle School. This is probably one of the best things I have done so far in college. My favorite part of UGA is going to football games and cheering on the Dawgs! Also, Athens is an amazing city with so much to do and everyone here is so nice. I’m definitely thankful that I have the opportunity to be a Bulldawg and attend the best university in the country.
