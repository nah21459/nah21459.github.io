 I was born on September 7, 1996 in a hospital located in St. Petersburg, Russia. Shortly after my birth, my biological parents placed me in a “special needs” orphanage because they could not afford the expenses associated with my numerous operations for multiple disabilities. For the next ten years I called the orphanage my “home”. Thanks to a miracle in 2006 a loving family from north Georgia adopted me. Upon arriving in the United States I required more orthopedic surgeries to assure I could walk.  Also, I had to learn a totally new language and start school for the first time in my life. With my parents support, I have been able to accomplish so many things that I never would have imagined when I was in the orphanage.
