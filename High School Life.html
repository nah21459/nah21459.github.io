I attended Wildwood Christian Academy located close to my neighborhood in Marble Hill, GA. I was super involved in leadership activities during my years in high school. I was the president of the National Honor Society, vice president of student government, and yearbook editor. Other extracurricular activities included:  swimming, Young Life, and Odyssey of the Mind. One of my favorite high school memories was a school beach trip to Pensacola, Florida. It was great because it was a time when I could bond and relax with my classmates without having to worry about schoolwork. Another favorite high school memory was my participation in the state high school swim meet. I am a competitive swimmer and I cherished qualifying in swimming at the state level. This event was rewarding and the huge crowd created an electric atmosphere. I placed 8th in the 200 yard freestyle which was a huge accomplishment for me considering I have Spina Bifida and cannot use my legs.
